## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### Continued development

I'm still not stable with the use of CSS GRID and FLEXBOX and I plan on developing my skill in this area because it was a bit challenging for me while doing the challenge.
